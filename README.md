# Spotify Bootstrapped by Chronically Late

## Roles:
- Aaron: PM
- Julia, Maya, Jasmine: Developers

## Description:
Our most certainly professional Spotify Bootstrapped will present you with a variety of Spotify stats relating to your Spotify year. There will be lots of data that your typical Spotify Wrapped may have failed to provide you with. As of right now, we are looking to include information about who your top artists were in multiple time frames, as well as time listened, most popular album from them, and percentage of total listeners for that artist. We are open to changing our idea depending on our ability to process the information that we are able to glean from the Spotify APIs. We will also provide a Artist informations section where you can learn more about your favorite artists!
